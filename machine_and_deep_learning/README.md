# Main Deep and Machine learning repository

Here I summarize all my experiments on Machine and Deep Learning, also all the development conducted on the different frameworks such as Tensorflow and Caffe. The subfolders are specified as follows:

1. **[pytorch_models](./pytorch_models)**: contains experiments conducted on pytorch framework such as model training, testing and visualization for difference models for instance:

    1.1. [Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.11239.pdf) with class conditioning and multi-gpu support.
    
    1.2. [ISTR: End-to-End Instance Segmentation with Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.00637)

2. **[FarePredictor](./FarePredictor)**: Exprimenting with Machine Learning models for predicting Taxi ride fares.


3. **[caffe_models](./caffe_models)**: contains experiments conducted on Caffe framework such as model training, testing and visualization.

4. **[Tensorflow_models](./Tensorflow_models)**: models development on tensorflow framework, for training, testing and visualizations

5. **[Tensorflow2Caffe_converter](./Tensorflow2Caffe_converter)**: a very simple model converter from tensorflow to caffe, the basic idea was discussed in [here](https://github.com/ethereon/caffe-tensorflow/issues/59)

**NOTE**: more to be added in the future ...
