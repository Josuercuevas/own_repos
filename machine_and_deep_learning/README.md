# Main Deep and Machine learning repository

Here I summarize all my experiments on Machine and Deep Learning, also all the development conducted on the different frameworks such as Tensorflow and Caffe. The subfolders are specified as follows:

1. **caffe_models/**: contains experiments conducted on Caffe framework such as model training, testing and visualization.

2. **Tensorflow_models/**: models development on tensorflow framework, for training, testing and visualizations

3. **Tensorflow2Caffe_converter/**: a very simple model converter from tensorflow to caffe, the basic idea was discussed in [here](https://github.com/ethereon/caffe-tensorflow/issues/59)

**NOTE**: more to be added in the future ...
